# The data source for this project comes from the South Bend Data Portal, and focuses on ethnicity data within their police recruiting process.

# The API functions developed for this project are GET_ETHNICITY, GET_TEST, GET_TESTS, GET_ETHNICTIES, PUT_RESULT, POST_RESULT, and DELETE_RESULT. The GET functions are used to make get requests and retrieve various data based on a test or ethnicity. PUT_RESULT will update a specific test result for a particular ethnicity, while POST_RESULT will increment the respective data for the particular ethnicity. DELETE_RESULT will then delete a specific candidate's entire application data.

# The full table with JSON specification can be found at this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCu4kMQ5VM_V39WjOPwB4ynSFCJYEurm2YRx8M5SLmU/edit

# These functions can be used to not only discover trends across tests for a single ethnicity or to see how different ethnicities tend to perform in each test, but they can also be used to compare two ethnicities side by side and analyze their tests.

# The test files for this project can be executed by running the command 'python3 test_api.py'.
